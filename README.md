# MSDA-Capstone

## Overview
Regression analysis of used car features and their inluence on pricing

## Tools Used
- Python
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- statsmodels
- scipy
- scikit-learn
- Google Colab

## Results (see Executive Summary)
The regression model showed a statistically significant relationship between the selected features and price differentials, but it demonstrated low explanatory power (R-Squared = 0.031). Although the model identified key predictors of price differentials, its predictive accuracy was limited. The Mean Squared Error (MSE) was found to be 1,622,434, and the Residual Standard Error (RSE) was high at 1,288.15, indicating significant unexplained variance.
